# archiveblogging

Use it here: [Archiveblogging on Leavins-Software.com](http://apps.leavins-software.com/archiveblogging/).

Start an event, write your throughts, and get a log (with timestamps) of those thoughts.

Feel free to call it 'Archiveblogging'; I'm not married to the whole lowercase thing.

I wanted to do some liveblogging while I watched Tusk for the first time. But I didn't want to flood any social media site with up-to-the-minute thoughts about the movie. I tried looking for something like archiveblogging and found nothing. So I wrote it!

## Implementation Details

archiveblogging is a Single Page Application (SPA) that uses:
* [React](https://facebook.github.io/react/)
* [Flux](http://facebook.github.io/flux/)
* [Browserify](http://browserify.org/)

And maybe a few other things too; see package.json for other dependencies. They're all cool technologies, so you should go check them out.
